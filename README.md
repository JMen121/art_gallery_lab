# Art Gallery Lab

This lab represents the collaborative effort of Rashad and I to develop a piece of software for a digital art gallery. The software is designed to manage artwork, artists, and customers, facilitating the sale of artwork and overall gallery management.



## Features

- A Customer is able to buy an Artwork from the Gallery, reducing the money in their wallet and increasing the money in the Gallery till.
- The Gallery Class is able to calculate the value of its collection with a stock_take() method.
- When an Artwork is purchased, it transfers from the Gallery stock collection to the Customer's artCollection.



## Lessons Learned

Initially, Rashad and I found it difficult to reduce the customers money in their wallet and increase the money in the Gallery till. However, when we broke up the methods using pseudo code, it became slightly more easier.


## Running Tests

In this work, we have multiple Test classes to ensure the validity of the code and assurity it works in the way we want it to.
